### Papers & Essays
 
- #### [From the Foxhole to the Ivory Tower Paper](https://github.com/drcdavidson/drcdavidson/blob/main/OtherProjects/From%20the%20Foxhole%20to%20the%20Ivory%20Tower%20-%20FINAL.pdf) 
  Abstract: More than 5,000,000 post-9/11 service members are expected to transition out of the military by 2020 due to a reduction in the size of the U.S. military and presence in Iraq and Afghanistan (American Council on Education, 2014). As these service members separate from the military many will choose to enter college. The purpose of this study was to explore the transition experiences of Post-9/11 student veterans from a military setting to college using Veteran Critical Theory to examine data collected from semi-structured interviews. The findings were presented as a composite narrative and add to and confirm a decade's worth of literature about the transition experiences of Post-9/11 student veterans. The findings also confirmed many of the tenets of Veteran Critical Theory (Phillips & Lincoln, 2017) especially related to the conflict between military, civilian, and academic cultures that disrupted student veterans' ability to adapt to their new role as civilian and student.

- #### [Computer Security Incidents](https://github.com/drcdavidson/drcdavidson/blob/7bc2ddd6b340fd73580b37d868ff8ecedefaef29/OtherProjects/Computer%20Security%20Incidents.pdf)
  Abstract: Computer security incidents have increased over the past decade for both the public and private sectors, and institutions of higher education are not immune to these incidents. This article explores computer security incidents and threats for higher education campuses, discusses the implications for higher education institutions, and makes recommendations for steps that higher education officials can take to mitigate these threats and incidents.
