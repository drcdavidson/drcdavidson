### Published Papers & Essays

- #### [The Higher Education Funding Revolution: An Exploration of Statewide Community College “Free Tuition” Programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_LVNlazA8uF4EHWvQrQbFzAIFJqJlSE8/view?usp=sharing) 
  Abstract: This article examines the current literature and state legislation of statewide free tuition promise programs. The purpose of this paper was to analyze state free community college programs, legislation, scholarly literature, and state websites to understand program structures, funding sources, and studenteligibility requirements. The following classifications of state programs emerged: community and technical college programs, workforce development programs, and programs for both 2- and 4-year degrees and certificates. Additionally, this article examines the similarities and differences between programs to inform future research and accompanying outcomes. 
  
- #### [Participation on Community College Students’ Perceptions of Learning Gains and Engagement](https://doi.org/10.1080/10668926.2020.1852983) 
  Abstract: This study investigated the relationship learning community participation has with community college students’ perceived learning gains and engagement in educationally purposeful activities. Study data were sourced from the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) with a total of 694 institutions and over 107,000 participants. To control for differences between community colleges, fixed-effects regressions were conducted. Findings indicate that learning community participation was significantly related with increased perceived learning gains and four of the CSSSE engagement benchmarks: active/collaborative learning, academic challenge, student-faculty interaction, and support for learners. Implications for community college policymakers and administrators are discussed.
  
- #### [From the Foxhole to the Ivory Tower Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PRL7dp3bLce8uGMWxmkmu3MK73oUlBE/view?usp=sharing) 
  Abstract: More than 5,000,000 post-9/11 service members are expected to transition out of the military by 2020 due to a reduction in the size of the U.S. military and presence in Iraq and Afghanistan (American Council on Education, 2014). As these service members separate from the military many will choose to enter college. The purpose of this study was to explore the transition experiences of Post-9/11 student veterans from a military setting to college using Veteran Critical Theory to examine data collected from semi-structured interviews. The findings were presented as a composite narrative and add to and confirm a decade's worth of literature about the transition experiences of Post-9/11 student veterans. The findings also confirmed many of the tenets of Veteran Critical Theory (Phillips & Lincoln, 2017) especially related to the conflict between military, civilian, and academic cultures that disrupted student veterans' ability to adapt to their new role as civilian and student.
  
- #### [Computer Security Incidents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JhPoRkZFuEIrusEhyYQR-UJqMqWV1kEY/view?usp=sharing)
  Abstract: Computer security incidents have increased over the past decade for both the public and private sectors, and institutions of higher education are not immune to these incidents. This article explores computer security incidents and threats for higher education campuses, discusses the implications for higher education institutions, and makes recommendations for steps that higher education officials can take to mitigate these threats and incidents.
  
### Dissertation 
- #### [Veteran Influx: A Qualitative Study Examining the Transition Experiences of Student Veterans from the Military to College](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/84939)
  Abstract: More than 5,000,000 post-9/11 service members are expected to transition out of the military by 2020 due to a reduction in the size of the U.S. military and presence in Iraq and Afghanistan (American Council on Education, 2014). As these service members separate from the military many will choose to enter college. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the transition experiences of Post-9/11 student veterans from a military setting to a college setting. The researcher in this study reviewed the literature about student veterans’ transition from the military to a college. This review led to the creation of the Student Veteran College Transition Model (SVCTM). The SVCTM was used to examine data collected from semi-structured interviews. Findings of this study confirmed previous research that student
veterans experience a challenging transition from the military to college and that military and veteran student offices and veteran student organizations play an important role in the transition for student veterans. The findings also included that the conflict between military, civilian, and academic cultures disrupted student veterans’ ability to adapt to their new role as civilian and student. To combat this conflict, student veterans turn to family and other veterans internal and
external to the college provide support during the transition from the military as they integrate their military, civilian, and academic identities.
  
 ### Grant Funded Research

- #### [Virginia Veterans Demonstration Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--yH-Nim63tReSETLY3zWmsA5FGoMrAr/view?usp=sharing)
  Abstract: From  July 2015 to August 2016, I served as a Project Associate & Graduated Research Associate at the Virginia Tech Institute of Policy and Governance while working on his doctoral degree. In colloboration with  StreamLines, LLC and other partners, he conducted research at the request of the Virginia Community College System - Workforce Development Services (VCCS-WDS), as part of the Virginia Veterans Demonstration Project funded by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Demonstration Project had four components intended to improve educational and employment opportunities for Virginia’s Transitioning Service Members (TSMs) and veterans. The asset mapping, best practices research and gap analysis were the key components of a formative evaluation study that provided research findings to support program and policy action recommendations for the Virginia Board of Workforce Development. In total there are seven (7) reports.   
  
### Reports 

- #### [University Student Emergency Relief Grants: Benchmarking Report for Implementing a Micro-or Emergency Grant Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qtg9tTIzfZWYlgrQyO_hNSguFUCWxfS/view?usp=sharing)
  Abstract: On behalf of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT), the Postsecondary Education Research Center (PERC) examined the use of micro- or emergency grants for students at aspirational and peer institutions. Additionally, PERC staff gathered information from programs at institutions with high Pell grant and high retention/graduation metrics across the United States. PERC staff reviewed information for 38 institutions and identified two program formats for microgrants or emergency funding for students: short-term or emergency loans and micro- or emergency grants. This report provides an overview of the two program formats, eligibility criteria, summary of current UT programs, and a recommendation and proposal for Smokey’s Grant.
